**Abstract**: The study analyzes the effectiveness of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation methods for
identifying anthropogenic objects with varying degrees of boundary variability in aerospace imagery. Neural
network models such as U-Net, PSPNet, DeepLabv3+, SegFormer, Twins-PCPVT, ConvNeXt, YOLOv7,
YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv11 are utilized.
The research involves annotating remote sensing data to determine the degree of boundary variability, conducting
experiments with neural networks, and developing an algorithm to compare the performance of networks
belonging to different segmentation types.
The results demonstrate that semantic segmentation models are more effective for detecting large-area objects with
pronounced boundary variability, while instance segmentation models achieve high recognition accuracy for
objects with minimal boundary variability
